        <h2>When Is the Best Time to Paint in Arizona?</h2>
        <p>The best times are typically <strong>fall (October–November)</strong> and <strong>spring (March–April)</strong>, when temperatures are mild. Arizona summers can affect curing; winters are often good for exterior work.</p>
        
        <h2>Can You Paint in Phoenix Summer?</h2>
        <p>Yes. We paint year-round and adjust timing, materials, and application methods for the heat. We use products designed for Arizona conditions.</p>
        
        <h2>Interior vs Exterior Timing</h2>
        <p>Interior painting can be done any time. Exterior work is more weather-dependent, but we schedule around Phoenix conditions.</p>
