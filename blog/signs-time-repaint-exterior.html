        <h2>1. Fading or Chalky Paint</h2>
        <p>Sun and heat cause paint to fade or turn chalky. If your color looks washed out or powdery, it’s time for a repaint.</p>
        
        <h2>2. Peeling or Bubbling</h2>
        <p>Peeling or bubbling usually means moisture or poor adhesion. Repainting with proper prep addresses the cause.</p>
        
        <h2>3. Visible Cracks</h2>
        <p>Cracks in stucco or paint should be repaired before repainting. We handle crack repair as part of our process.</p>
        
        <h2>4. Mold or Mildew</h2>
        <p>Mold or mildew needs to be cleaned and treated. We clean and prep before painting.</p>
        
        <h2>5. It's Been 8–10 Years</h2>
        <p>Most exterior paint jobs last 8–10 years in Phoenix. If it’s been that long, consider a repaint.</p>
